eyes. An aura of cold and darkness radiates from it, which makes it an
ominous and fearsome sight. Despite the wasted, rotten flesh it is garbed
in the rich clothes of nobility.

with mottled, grey, mossy protrusions, like some strange malignant
blemishes. It emits low, guttural mewlings from its fanged, quivering
orifice.
